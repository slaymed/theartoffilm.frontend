                                Film posters are my passion and I’ve been collecting film posters and movie memorabilia
                                probably since I was about 13 years old – I became friends with my local cinema managers
                                and video shop owners in the 1980s. They used to give me film and video posters once the
                                run was over – anything film-related that was destined for the bin would inevitably land
                                up in my bedroom as a teenager.By the time I was in my mid-teens, I had no wall space or
                                even ceiling space left. Most of my friends had pictures of movie stars or favourite
                                bands up on their walls I had Kubrick posters, Coppola posters, Spielberg posters,
                                DePalma posters and so much more on my walls (OK – and 1 poster of my favourite group
                                back then Queen!). Arriving in London in my late teens, I discovered Film Fairs – 4
                                shows a year or so, which reignited my passion for collecting film posters. My interest
                                started growing again – initially I was only collecting Stanley Kubrick material,
                                however over time it has widened to encompass a huge range of titles.

                        There are 3 main reasons why I collect film posters – firstly I love the artwork that
                        encapsulates the film – as soon as you look at a specific poster, the film comes flooding back
                        to you.
                    </Paragraph>
                    <Paragraph className="tracking-wider leading-6 text-slate-400">
                        We all have our favourite movies – some of mine include Zulu, Lawrence of Arabia, Monty Python
                        and the Holy Grail, Jaws, 2001 A Space Odyssey, Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind,
                        Raiders of the Lost Ark and many more of course, and I am lucky enough to have all these
                        original cinema release posters in my collection – some in multiple formats from around the
                        world.

                    <Paragraph className="tracking-wider leading-6 text-slate-400">
                        Secondly the original poster artists created such iconic images that are recognisable around the
                        world. Secondly, a lot of classic titles are valuable or are becoming more valuable over time.
                        So they are investment pieces as well as works of art. And thirdly,
                    </Paragraph>
                    <Paragraph className="tracking-wider leading-6 text-slate-400">
                        I just love looking at them framed up on my walls. It gives me a sense of joy to see a favourite
                        original film poster displayed as they were designed to do.

                        I suppose I would really love my own independent cinema – all the décor and posters would be
                        treated with utmost love and respect – one day I will build my own home cinema! So today, my
                        original film poster collection stretches to over 600 titles from around the world

                        I love the UK quad format, but I also have many US 1 sheets, French grandes and petites, Italian
